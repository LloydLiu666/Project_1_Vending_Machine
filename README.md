## `Readme for "Project_1_Vending_Machine"`
This repository is built to upload the project I did in a extra curricular computer science course.

"Vending_Machine.c" is a program in C, which is simulating a vending machine. The interface is English.

"Randomizer" is also a program in C, which can generate a random integer from 1 to PPL_NUMB by using the current time as the "seed".
